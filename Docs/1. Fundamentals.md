# Architecture

- Host applications as containers 
- 2 planes -> Control plane and Data plane
- **Control plane** contains 
    - **The master node**, which manage, plans, schedules, monitor nodes
    - **ETCD cluster** , a key value distributed database to store metadata about the cluster
    - **kube-scheduler** , that scheules the application containers on the worker nodes based on the resource requirement, taints, etc., 
    - **Kube Controller Manager** ,
        a) Node Controller, handles onboarding new nodes, situation handling during nodes becomes unavilable or destroyed
        b) Replication Controller, makes sure desired number of replicas running
    - **API server**, responsible for orchestrating all the operations inside the cluster, by acting as a communication channel between master components, used by users    
      to perform management operations, monitor the state of the cluster by monitoring the states of the controllers and make the necessary changes.
- **Data plane** contains woker nodes running applications as container
    - **Container Runtime** In addition to Docker, other supported container runtime platforms are Rocket, ContainrD
    - **Kubelet** is the agent running on the worker nodes that listens to instructions coming from the API server to create/delete containers, etc., Kubelet receives periodic states of the nodes and the containers running on them. 
    - **Kube-Proxy** service enables communication between nodes and the containers running on different nodes.
