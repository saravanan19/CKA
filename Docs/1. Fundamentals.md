# Architecture

- Host applications as containers 
- 2 planes -> Control plane and Data plane
- Control plane contains 
    - **The master node**, which manage, plans, schedules, monitor nodes
    - ** ETCD cluster** , a key value distributed database to store metadata about the cluster
    - ** kube-scheduler **, that scheules the application containers on the worker nodes based on the resource requirement, taints, etc., 
- Data plane contains worker nodes running applications as container
